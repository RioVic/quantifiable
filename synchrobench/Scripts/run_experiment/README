To run the quantifiable benchmarks:

./run_benchmarks.sh

This script compiles the necessary binaries and runs them in loops to create inversion counts for linkedlist/lazy-list.

To then create graphs for those inversion counts:

./generate_graphs.sh

And all the histogram graphs will end up in results/*items/*.pdf.

Experimenting
=============

To change what is graphed / experimented on, just change the loop values in run_benchmarks.sh and generate_graphs.sh.


graph.R
=======

This script makes a histogram graph of any given set of inversion data files, with any parameters, as long as they are
all named par1_par2_par3_etc_inversions.dat. From the filenames, it will figure out what parameters are different and
only display any discriminating ones in the legend.
