Dependencies:
Boost library
pthreads

To build:
$make

For help running:
$./a.out --help

Running ./a.out will generate two files. *_ideal.dat and *_parallel.dat. In order to count inversions, these files must both be moved to the ../Scripts directory before running the analysis program located there.
